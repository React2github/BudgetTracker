## How it Works

Users can create an account and login to their dashboard. They will be able to enter their weekly expenses and monthly bills. <br>
The app will create a pie graph breakdown of their spending habits and they will get a visual display of their budget. 

## Problems During Development

Conflicts can occur often when code reviewing pull requests. It's important for all contributers to be current with master so when local changes are pushed into the repo, manual corrections can be kept to a minimium.
